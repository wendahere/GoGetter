Grace Orchard School (GOS) is a special school which
provides holistic education to students wilth Mild
Intellectual Disability (MID) and Mild Autism
Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The age of student ranges
from 7 to 18 years old. It is situated in 6A Jurong West,
Street 52. As part of the school’s effort to inculcate
good values, and mannerism among their students,
GOS had developed an innovative reward system to
encourage and “celebrate” good behaviours. Each
student is given a small card which he/she must bring
to school every day. This enable teachers who
spotted a good behaviours to seize a teachable
moment to give acknowledgment; by giving the
student a stamp mark on the card. Each stamp mark
carries some points which the students could
accumulate to exchange for some gifts in the
“Treasury” cabinet. The Treasury cabinet is manned by a staff at various timeslots. One of the
pain points in administrating this programme is to have staff to physically reward the students
with gift that matches their accumulated points. It would be desirable to automate the gift
dispensing operation. Bearing in mind the wide range of students’ age, gender and special
needs; sound empathy studies and ergonomic consideration must be carried out.


Objectives:
To design and build a low cost, reliable and user friendly Gift Vending Machine for dispensing
relevant items that match students’ accumulated points. This is to encourage good
behaviours among students and afford staff efficiency in administrating the reward system.
